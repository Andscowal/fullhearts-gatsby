The desire to be a better man is so overwhelming.
God, it's overwhelming.

I wake up everyday, go to bed every night, wondering what I can do later to be the best man for the best woman.

I finally have come up with something.

After spending so many hours, I realized that it's not enough to try to come up with solutions. 

It's far better to just <i>truly desire</i> to be a better man, and have everything come naturally.

I have that desire, and I can say with confidence that one day, I'll make you my wife.

And this world will be ours.
