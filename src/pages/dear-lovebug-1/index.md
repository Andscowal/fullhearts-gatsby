Dear Lovebug,

I wanted to do something different for you today. 
<br>
Today, I wanted to write you a short letter telling you about a thought I had.

I imagined the future, standown, where I finally meet your family. I imagined your mom asking me something. She asked me: "What do you think about our family?" I would most absolutely tell her the one thing that I'm already thinking. "Thank you. Thank you for introducing me to your family." In this daydream, she continued to ask me: Why would I thank her for that? And I responded to her "Because I just had to meet the family that brought up someone as wonderfully perfect as Manda." It's been sometime since I had this thought, Lovebug, but my mind frequently goes back to it. It's like you give me new reasons to think highly of you every time we speak. You give me new reasons to think you're beautiful, or to think you're smart, or that you love your family (like talking to your grandma! Wow! So wholesome!), or that you're this total perfect sweetheart! My point is, I think you're the most wonderful, amazing woman, and there isn't enough I could say to express how happy, or thankful, or appreciative I am for being in your life! 

I love you so much, Lovebug! And good morning!
