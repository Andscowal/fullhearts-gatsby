My Darling Blue, Amanda...

We at long last match!

I can't believe it took this long,

Because you're the greatest "catch"!

I cannot see myself without you by my side,

For you, I'd travel across the country,

Anywhere far and wide!

I know I did it once, and of course, I'll do it twice!

I'll do anything for you, my lovely Future Wife!

I have waited a long time to say this to you,

But I am sending you all my heart,

Love Always, Future Mr. Blue,

And may we never be apart!
