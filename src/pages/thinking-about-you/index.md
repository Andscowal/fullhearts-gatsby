I'm not sure if you'll wake with the shine of the sun or the shimmer of snow, but just know that I'm thinking about you. I'm thinking about marrying you. I'm thinking about spending the rest of my days holding your hands when you're cold and your chin when you're sad, and your whole loveliness on my shoulders when you're stressed. I'm thinking about your name and how it pushes me to do more, to be more. I'm thinking about how I shouldn't give up no matter where I set my sights. I'm thinking about how I'm going to welcome you home after a long day and how hard I'm going to kiss you before every goodbye we're forced to say. Dear Lovebug, every minute of every day, I'm thinking about you.
