If I could just make you see how my eyes lit up or how my heart ignited when you spoke of your success...

If I could shout through the time and space between us, oh the things I would tell you...

I would rest tonight knowing that you know that I think you are the most brilliant soul in all of mankind.

Passionate, smart, beautiful, strong, funny...

Everything I wish I could be.

But I'm not and that's okay.

Because there is only one person who could accomplish the impossible. 

From earning that pin to winning my heart, that person has always been...

You.
