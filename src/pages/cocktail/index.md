I'm wondering if you have some kind of secret formula. A magic cocktail to turn you into the most amazing woman of all time! The kind of woman a guy is excited to take home to mom! The kind of woman he's excited to be husband to! The kind of woman who has worked for everything she's got! The kind of woman that usually only exists in the dreams of men...

But not you.

No, you're real.

Somehow, you've danced from our minds and off the pages of storybooks and into real life. A fantasy and yet reality, you've shown me all it takes to make expectations reality, is just a little belief. And that's such a beautiful gift to have given me.

Thank you so much Mrs. Blue.

I love you.
