Once upon a time, there was an evil being named Depression.

He was joined hand in hand by despair.

Depression was used to being in charge,

And Despair was always just... there.

They poked and prodded and menaced with malice,

And targeted such a man, whose name was Alice.

He sat and wept, the odds were against him,

Until one day, hope shimmered and shone down on them.

A screech, a growl, a roar here too.

Depression and Despair melted to glue.

A black tar was left where they once stood,

A substance so sticky, it would work on wood!

Alice was confused, why did the evil turn in?

Out from hope, emerged one good person.

Hello, Alice, my name is Miranda.

I have a great dream for us, from roof to veranda!

I would hope that you agree and take my hand.

For when you do, we will go to a new land!

Alice stood and thought it was strange to even ponder.

For Miranda was amazing and filled him with wonder!

He knew it was right and she created a big fan!

So all that he did, was reach out his hand.

And so ends the story of Alice and Miranda,

And to this day, they are in love,

On their veranda.
