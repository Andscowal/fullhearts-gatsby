As I lay here,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes are puffy, my body is numb.

As I lay here,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An illness grabs hold, as I try to run.

As I lay here,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling sick of body, but sound of mind.

As I lay here,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is full, for forever's time.

As I lay here,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not a cure for a cough.

As I lay here,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need your smile, for that's more than enough.

For upon closing my eyes, I'm left with this picture.

Your mind, spirit and body, my perfect mixture.
