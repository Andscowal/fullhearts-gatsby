There are eleven stars in my sky. Each one a new aspect I love in my dark life that's been brightened so beautifully every time one is directly overhead.

<i>11.</i> The last star is so bright, it lights my way. It guides my path to a better me.

<i>10.</i> Ten is humorous. Telling jokes so that the other stars may gleam with laughter.

<i>09.</i> The ninth star is petty. Angry that I have love for the other stars in the night sky. And yet, also angry that I love it too.

<i>08.</i> The eighth star is passionate. The fiery passion drives the perseverance it needs to stay lit bright enough to be seen.

<i>07.</i> The seventh star is loud. It's voice booms to the moon and back all so that someone may hear its beautiful song.

<i>06.</i> Six, is hope. The hope that everything will work out in the end. Despite all odds. This star is so lovely.

<i>05.</i> Perhaps just as lovely is the fifth star. The fifth star is sleepy. Hypnotic to look at, it puts you to sleep on sight to restore good energy and wonderful feelings.

<i>04.</i> The fourth is Gorgeous. Raw, untouched, and real.

<i>03.</i> The third... Dear lord, the third star is so wise. It passes down to the earth good reasoning and it's natural laws.

<i>02.</i> The second star is intelligent. Glistening so brightly because it knows how to outshine the rest.

<i>01.</i> The first star. The first star is strong. It is with this strength that it's able to lead the rest as they follow suit in the sky.

I found each of these teachings in the stars so easily. One for each day we were together. And now, when I look at the night sky; I'll forever remember these days we shared, and 11 few of the many reasons why I love you.
