It's crazy how we ended up here, in this little land.

Manda, you knock me off my feet, you're the only one who can.

It is swift and telling, how you make me feel.

It tells me oh so many things, like this love is just too real!

One that you could touch with a simple poke of your finger!

But others are scared to poke it, though,

Because it would surely linger!

Seeing us together would easily give them the bug!

But that's something I'm okay with,

Because I am just so in love!
