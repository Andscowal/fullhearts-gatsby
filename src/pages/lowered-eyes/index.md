You will not cry yourself to sleep tonight or any night onward;

Your beauty is unmatched, as your heavy eyes fall lower.

A golden brown galaxy in each, your sight fades as you slip to your dreams;

Your hands are far softer than the whispers of the winds by every means.

I couldn't have made you up, in my wildest dreams;

But your tears will not fall for me, not even a stream.

You won't be alone, not ever again;

Even if you don't feel me, just look within.

You'll always have my words, and soon my deep smile;

Even if it means I'm a little sad just for a little while.

One day you'll wake up with me next to you;

And you'll remember not crying, when times begged you to.

And I'll look down on you, as I hold you tightly in my arms;

Your dry eyes will glimmer brighter than mars.

I'll think to myself and feel like I've roamed;

But in that moment, looking into your eyes, I'll know that I'm home.

You will not cry yourself to sleep tonight, or any night onwards;

Your smile is wide, heart is full, and eyes finally lowered.

Boy was I straight ignant with this one. What, did I never think you'd go on deployment? Did I ever think I had control over what the Navy makes you do? Sometimes I lay awake in our bed just leaking over you being gone, conquering the world. In part because I'm sad and I miss you, but in greater part, because I'm so proud of all you've accomplished.

I love you Mrs. Blue.
