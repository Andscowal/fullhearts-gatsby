When the wind rises above the tallest mountains of the world, I can find belief in something greater than myself. It happens so often, and so naturally that it's the only thing that makes sense to me anymore.

And now...

I have climbed to the tops of the tallest mountains.

I have felt the wind breeze across my eyes...

And it has made me believe in something greater than myself.

It's made me believe in you.
