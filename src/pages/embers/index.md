Perfection. 

There you sit next to me, smelling of firewood, glowing in your natural beauty.
<br>
Somehow you've convinced my heart to set off fireworks in my soul and light me up brighter than the sun.
<br>
Your loving embrace warmingly invites me in, and I follow.
<br>
For in your arms, the embers of love forever burn.
