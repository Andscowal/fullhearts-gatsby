Thank you.

Thank you for loving the world, for making it anew.

Thank you for trying your hardest, to be the perfect you.

Nothing you do will ever let me down.

So thank you for allowing me to kneel before your crown.

Thank you for the laughter, it heals me throughout.

Thank you for smiling so beautifully, it makes me want to shout.

Thank you for giving yourself, to the things you believe in entirely.

I know many people whose lives you've changed rightfully.

Thank you for always remembering the roots beneath your wings.

And thank you even more for showing it in all your things.

You may have to miss holidays as work may take you far,

But please always remember, I love who you are.

I can wait my turn, if time can be forgiving.

But right now, I want to thank you so much, and wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.

I love you my Sweet Blue.
