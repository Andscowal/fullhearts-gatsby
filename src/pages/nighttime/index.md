When we are apart, nighttime is my absolute favorite!

We become unified by dreams.

A space hidden away from loneliness, we don't need saving,

But instead, I'm down on one knee!

I love being the one to lead.

You'll see where my wildest dreams can come true!

So, my love, won't you lay with me?

As I say goodnight to you?

Goodnight my dearest, most loving Blue.

And I hope that you can say that you love nighttime too!
