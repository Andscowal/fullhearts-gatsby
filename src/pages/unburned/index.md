Sweet Manda, Sweet Manda. How I long for your smile.

I wish to give and to take and to stay a long while!

Dreams shout loud when looking down a gun.

But you threaten back, "come 'round when I'm done."

It is because you are fearless, that the gun never returns.

It is because you love, that you emerge unburned.
