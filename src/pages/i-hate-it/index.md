There is a lot that I would do for you.

There is a lot that I have done.

I hate it when you make me laugh,

And shine brighter than the sun.

I hate it when I'm up all night, thinking about your smile.

I hate it when we go to sleep for one forever while.

I hate it when I make no sense, like my dumb corny jokes.

And worst of all I hate it when you try to fight me, because it's me who loves you most!
