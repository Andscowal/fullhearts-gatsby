A foggy mist sprinkles a seaspray overhead,

We're walking on the beach.

I want to say what should have always been said,

So I'll ask you to take a seat!

You'll find it weird that there is a chair.

It'll be a bit chilly with the beachfront air.

I'll say "Trust me, I know what I'm doing.",

And you'll sit with a smile.

And from under the chair I'll grab a shovel,

And start digging for a while.

Under the surface of the sand,

I will grab a box.

Around the outside will be "Respect", followed by a lock.

There may be some other words too,

But whatever they are, they show my love for you!

On your person, you'll have a key.

Pull it out, give it a turn, you'll see!

Open the box like a chest of treasure.

I'll help you out, for good measure!

Inside you'll find a few random objects.

Looking like they belong to a most special set!

You'll find a list, a story, or a poem within.

With something about you that makes me grin!

All of these things will show you we're a team!

And that's when you'll realize, I'm on bended knee!

I've never been more excited!

Will you marry me?
