Sweet Blue, Dear Blue, kiss me with your words, love me with your hands.

Pluck my heart to the beat of your breath.

Oh my, Darling Blue, bring my life into color.

For you and you alone, Natural Blue, with scent of nature drawn from your roots, have the power to spread your hue.

Spring Blue, Lovely Blue... Be Mine...

Darling Blue, I've craved my whole life to say it... 

At long last, I can live my life, in color.
