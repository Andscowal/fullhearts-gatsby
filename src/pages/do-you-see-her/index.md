Do you see her?

The loveliest woman to walk this earth.

Her gorgeous eyes gleam in the sunshine.

Blue, then green, then brown.

Radiating from the soul. 

Heating up my world as your sun-touched skin kissed mine so passionately. 

A window to her soul, her eyes stared back at me; and her kind-hearted, gentle smile was my invitation.

Here in this moment, I feel the most serene feeling life has to offer.

Here, I know

That I love you.
