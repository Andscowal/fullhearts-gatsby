There is an infinite amount of things that I love about you!

Your smile, your warm embrace, your calming voice, and your outspoken, yet soft spirit...

Yes, those things make up only a handful of your perfection, but right now, all I can think about is your love.

You've got that kind of love I can take with me no matter where I am.

Across the country or across the bed, I know that you love me and you will love me forever.

To receive that kind of love, to have that kind of attention... 

It's incredible!

I wake up every morning <i>thinking</i> I'm undeserving of it,

And I go to bed every night <i>knowing</i> I am.

You're such a spectacular woman and I thank the powers that be that you're in my life!

I don't know what led you here, but I'm going to give you the love, affection, dedication and respect that you deserve so that I can say that I proudly love you, and one day look back on our lives together and know that I loved you right!

I'm so confident in that, Manda!

I'm going to love you right!
