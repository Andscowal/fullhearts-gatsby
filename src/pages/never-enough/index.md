I know I don't have a sep date yet or anything, but I know you and how amazing you are and I know the Navy and I know they are going to take you away from me as much as possible, so you had better believe that I'm going to cherish every moment of every day I have with you!

I'm going to hold you close and hold you tight and kiss you hard. I'm going to make sure you know you're loved! I'm going to put our hearts together, so they know how close they belong! 

Because if there is one thing in this life that I can't get enough of, it's you. Even when you're hundreds of miles away or off on the ocean defending me, it will always be you.
