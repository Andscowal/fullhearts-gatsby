Dear Lovebug,

Sooooo I've written and rewritten this hundreds of times, trying to come up with the best way to tell you this, but I couldn't find the right words. So I am just going to come right out and say it...

...I'm so in love with you.

I know, I know, it sounds like something so simple, right? 

Well, it isn't. You see, I'm not just in love with you. I'm in love with your past, present and your future. I'm in love with the way you were raised. The people you were raised with, the people you grew up around. I'm in love with the idea that you're going to show our future family exactly what it means to be strong and grab life by the balls and become whoever they want to be! I'm so confident you'll show them life is limitless, because that's what you've shown me. And I can't thank you enough for that...

A lot of what I'm saying now feels familiar, it feels repeated, and that makes me happy because I know that I don't wait until something like Valentine's Day to tell you exactly what you mean to me! 

Anyways, you just called me and said helloooo in the cutest way imaginable, so I'm gonna end it here. I just want you to know, this is just one of many I LOVE YOU's!!!

I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!
