I know how you love Red Bull,

I know it gives you wings,

But sometimes I wonder if you knew any of these things:

That Rhododendrons are red,

And Bluebonnets are blue,

I like your butt,

And your smile too!

It's one that easily keeps me alive,

And I'm in love with your generosity,

As you make my happiness thrive!
