Dear Lovebug,

My heart...

It belongs to you. I may not have control anymore. I may get down on my knees and carry you on my shoulders so that others may see your grace and that you may reach your dreams. I may sprint the length of the country and back... but my heart is forever yours.

Today is another day I've spent across the country. I think it's crazy how people are always like, ecstatic to leave their world as they know it and become someone new in some distant place. But I realize now that I only feel like that because you've literally become who I am as a person. 

My determination is derived from your spirit. 
<br>
My intelligence is only so by your lessons. 
<br>
My beauty is merely a poor imitation of yours. 

And through these infinite avenues of possibility, I've lost control over the one thing that had belonged to me.

My heart...
