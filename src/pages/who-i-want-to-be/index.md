To be thought of as a man who will treat you right. A man who will hold your hand higher than the sky. A man who will lift your chin and bring your eyes to mine. A man who will hold your heart with more delicacy than a thousand diamonds. To be thought of as a man who will love you so unconditionally, my heart could stop. 

That's the man I want to be.
