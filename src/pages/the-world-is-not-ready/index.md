Within my phone, I have a picture of your back.

We had just rose from lying in bed, whispering sweet nothings and trading laughs and smiles!

You had lines in your back from the twists and curls of the covers.

Each line was so defined, I could trace it.

I could press my finger on your skin and trace upwards and spell out "I love you".

But I know my finger would turn into my whole hand rubbing your soft skin as your back flexed its mightiness at me!


<br>

All I could do, is stare in amazement and wonder. 

All I could think, is that the world is not ready for you...

Perfection...

Manda.
