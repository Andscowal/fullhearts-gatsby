I dream one day to hold all the gold summer offers.

I dream one day to not speak, but listen to the voice of an angel.

I dream one day to be blessed by a diamond whose brilliance exceeds life.

I dream one day for more perfection than winter snowflakes.

I dream one day for happiness hotter than life.

I dream one day for a feeling that would carry it all, on it's kind shoulders.

I dream one day that you'll see what I have, and you'll know that it's you.
