I would allow her to place hot stones on my back, if it meant her rising to the top.

I would gladly be staring at my phone, if she says she might need help.

I would hand carve my heart, if she needed a transplant.

I would bleed my feet running, if she needed me there.

I would give my whole life, to hold her at night forever.

I would.

I would.
