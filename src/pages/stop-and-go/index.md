I don't know what to tell you, babe.
It was all stop and go on my way to you.
I had a lot of time to think.

The same thought kept playing over and over in my head.

Others would see it like I'm going to nothing but a small bed, in a tiny room, with no cell service, an hour and a half out.

But I see it as all of that, <i>and that I'm going to you.</i>

I had some of the best nights of my life there. 
And on those late night drives home, I would be so disappointed.

Driving on the dark roads, I only wanted to turn around and go back to you.

Because just as I thought before, it crossed my mind again.

I didn't know the road ahead; I couldn't see a damn thing.
But somehow I knew that it was leading me to you.
