<strong>The woman who made me</strong> is as wonderful as ever; she has given me the tools for successful endeavors. I would not be here if not for her, and so I say thank you for bringing me into the world.

<strong>The woman who built me</strong>, the same as who made me, I cannot express my true gratitude, for it was you who showed me how to have the right attitude. Approach a woman with kindness and make sure to love her heart, and if she's got a lovely smile, then that's a good start! Do anything for her, the woman you love! But first make sure that she's an angel from above! These are the secrets I wish I had known, so I give them to you, as one of my own! If happiness is truly what you desire, then be sure to find a woman with a passionate fire!

I said yes, please, and thank you, and went on my way, out into the world, in search of a better day! It took me many years, my body was freezing, but then I found her, <i>the woman who completes me.</i>

<strong>The woman who completes me</strong>, I have become who I am and I love who you are, so let's run away and be with the stars. 

And I must mention that you are the woman who stands in the rain for cell service, and to you I have surrendered my heart, body, and soul so that we may stand in the rain together forever as it washes away the Ill Fates of the world and leaves behind only us and our love -- suspended in time. 

I know that I have lost my rhyme but it's because I have only one thing left to say: I'll love you, Manda, for the rest of my days.
