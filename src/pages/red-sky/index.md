A red sky at night, love is in the air.

Don't worry Lovebug, I'm almost there. 

Blue seas grant mysticism matched by your eyes.

They are sprinkled with hazel and make Mother Earth cry.

Your intelligence is matched, only by your elegance.

My saving grace, you've reached out for me, and have shown me my relevance.
