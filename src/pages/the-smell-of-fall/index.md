I love the smell of fall...

The scent of the changing leaves.

As seasons change, I love it all,

And all it means to me.

It means giving candy to monsters,

And losing out on daylight.

It's really a scary factor,

That feels like no end's in sight.

But it doesn't matter to me,

Few things do.

All that really matters is,

That fall reminds me of you.
