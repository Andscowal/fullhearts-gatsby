There was a time when I couldn't speak my mind.

My teeth hardened, and my thoughts were locked away in a pitch black cell, in a hole, on an island.

It was hard to get them out, the gatekeeper could never be found.

A prisoner to myself, I watched my life from the outside.

But things started changing when you came around.

You showed me how to grab life and take it for myself.

I crawled out from the darkness as you reached out your guiding hand.

When I felt your touch, I knew I had become within and without.

When you came around, my life did too.

When you came around, the darkness <i>hid.</i>

When you came around, everything was...

better.
