Bluebonnet, bluebonnet, you are my home.

From your stem to your cups, I feel so...

Blue personified is you.

Blue is calming, soothing in nature.
<br>
Blue is power, reserved for good use.
<br>
Blue is warm, a country glow.
<br>
Blue is unique, like the lone star flown.

Bluebonnet, bluebonnet, you are my home.
