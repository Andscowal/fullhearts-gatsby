My midnight moon and morning Blue, you know who you are.

'Bonnets are singing in daylight, while your night brings the stars.

Bless the road you walk, for you leave it filled with smiles!

Bless you for showing me love that shall never go out of style!

I hope you feel it returned and that it moves you out of your seat!

And to anyone who threatens to dim your light, <strong>you send them to me.</strong>
