We had only one, last California night.

Since then, the skies have cried.

I may have as well, in the slight.

When you left, I nearly died.

I know it's not your fault, nor even your choice.

And these days of late, I've loved hearing your voice.

Your amazing spirit, I love completely.

Come what may, I'm forever your Sweety!
