You mean so much to me... like fixed air to my lungs, you are my oxygen. I breathe in and you're there, back out and you're gone. <br>
<red><i>Thump, thump.</i></red>

The withered sounds put me at ease, as the uncertain becomes certain again, and I am in control, waiting for the end. <br>
<red><i>Thump, thump. Thump, thump. Thump, thump.</i></red>

A rush of blood fills my body. My heart regains speed. The withered sounds wither away. My lungs are fine. Everything has become right with this world once again. 

You told me you loved me... <br>
<red><i>Thump, thump. Thump, thump. Thump, thump. Thump, thump. Thump, thump.</i></red>
