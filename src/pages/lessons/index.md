Out of all the opportunities the Navy was supposed to bring me, happiness was not one of them.

I was not supposed to enjoy boot camp.

I was not supposed to go far in Great Lakes.

I was not supposed to have fond memories there either.

I was not supposed to come to California and excel.

I was supposed to get college, get bills paid and be miserable.

But I wasn't.

Because what no one told me was that all of it:

The ASMO, the room inspection failures, the uniform inspection hits, the pushing me down to see me rise again...

It was all made to bring me to you and that's the greatest thing I've learned from the Navy.
