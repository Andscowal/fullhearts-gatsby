Daylight spirits play while nightlife rests;
<br>
Nighttime sprites sing the spirits to bed;
<br>
Sunshine softness puts smiles in the air;
<br>
Moonlit moods let nostalgia flare!
<br>
The city life is real, and oh so bright;
<br>
And when darkness falls, we turn off the light.
<br>
Retreat to our hotel, climb into bed;
<br>
Up all night, not a single word said.
