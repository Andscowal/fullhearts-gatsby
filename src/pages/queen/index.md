I started loving myself again as I read between the paint of olive green, navy blue and sunshine yellow.

It hid a map that brought me to the top of a castle which held a princess in need of saving.

I found the princess, she was lovely.

She was waiting for me to rescue her and so I did.

She was in tears, but clear, when I told her the woman meant for me didn't need saving.

And so she was rescued from the idea that she needs a Knight's help for anything.

She had a kind heart and directed me to the Queen's throne room so that I may receive a reward.

And there, sitting in the chair, crown upon your head you stared back at me...

And I knew I was in love.
