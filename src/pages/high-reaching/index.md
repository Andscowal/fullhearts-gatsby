I reached high.

I streatched my hands so high to reach you and I come up miles short.

And your lowered hands...

You reached down those miles for me and bring me to you.

They find me...

Pulled from the nothingness, at last I am in heaven, with you.

I reached high, and your lowered hands, they find me.
