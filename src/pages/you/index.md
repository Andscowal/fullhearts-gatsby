<p>Poetry is only as deep as the reader wants it to be.</p>

<i>If she is lovely,</i> then the writing too will be lovely.

<i>If she is wise,</i> then so too will the writing be wise.

<i>If she is strong,</i> the writing will have strength.

<i>If she is a leader,</i> then the writing too will lead.


And if she is all of these things, then she is you.
