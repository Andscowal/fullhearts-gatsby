To the woman who has supported me unconditionally,
<br>
To the woman who settles for nothing less than my best,
<br>
To the woman who is there at the end of my long nights,
<br>
To the woman who will be there at my earliest of mornings,
<br>
To the woman who smooths out my rough days,
<br>
To the woman who dries out my sadness,
<br>
To the woman who I call mine,
<br>
Thank you, and I will love you

beyond the end of time.
