Dear Lovebug,

It's a shame you haven't seen Inception yet. They have a scene where they talk about getting lost in dreams, having no way out. The main guy is describing why his wife went crazy and eventually killed herself. See, originally, they used dreaming to just create beautiful things in a fictional world they would otherwise not have. She loved it so much she never wanted to wake, but he did because they have kids who they couldn't leave without parents. So to convince her to get out of the dream, every day he told her that her world wasn't real. It eventually got through to her and she woke up, except to wake up, you have to die in your dream. That idea followed her to the waking world and she thought she had to wake up again so she killed herself for real on accident.

The morale of the story being that being in a dream can be so addicting and it's easy to get caught up in something that isn't real.

Anyways, I know it's my favorite movie, but to hell with that. I don't care where I see you. Whether it's when I close my eyes and smell your perfume or when I'm awake and can feel your touch... no matter <i>which</i> you  I'm spending time with, I've always had the time of my life! When we dream together, that is when you join me in mine and we can walk the halls of our dream house, fight off Korean Special Forces to protect the President, and had birthdays for our beautiful children! And it is always so lovely. Of course I would go back... But when I'm awake... When I can see you, and smell you, and feel  you, and feel the vibrations of your voice on my body as you whisper in my ear... I can't believe how truly sensational you are. 

I am so thankful you chose to have me in your life and I'll forever appreciate the privilege to be the man who makes you happy, just as you're the woman who makes me happy!

I love you so much Beautiful! 

Sweet Dreams!
